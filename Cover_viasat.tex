Dear Hiring Manager,


I am writing to apply for the New Graduate Software Engineer position at the Viasat Baltimore location. I have a masters in physics and a solid amount of programming experience mainly in C++ and experience using linux shells and scripting and think I would make an excellent addition to your team.

I am very interested in finding an exciting technology related company where I can expand my programming knowledge while still using my strong background in physics, mathematics, and data analysis. I first started learning programming during my REU at William and Mary in 2010 and have been interested in improving my While in the Physics graduate program I worked on experimental hadronic physics and mainly did data analysis through writing programs using the ROOT data analysis library in C++.
